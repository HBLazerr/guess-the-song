replace the 'Search genres..' bar componenent in Game Mode to a new separate component where the user can input their guess and it will display a dropdown of options. keep the song options below as an alternative if tey wish to search for it instead of type. remove the old search bar from the Album Game Mode.

play again button in home screen should take to loading screen and load up the game with the exact same tracks/songs.

when playing a game with all artists songs, some songs are the same name just existing in other albums. find out how to combat this so the user doesnt lose a point for pressing the wrong one even though the song is the same. i suggest having an OR concept where if the artist has the same or similar song name like 'No Me Quise Ir' and 'No Me Quise Ir - Deluxe' or 'No Me Quise Ir (Remix)' then make any of those acceptable as the correct answer.

auto refresh when loading a new game.

share button should support save to camera roll for phones and save filefor PCs and also maybe connecting to instagram Story and DMs.

when playing a game with all artists songs, the search bar should pull songs in the dropdown not album names.

if user already played/guessed that album or artist, it should show a stat in the corner of the album or artist art picture.

add option to set the rules like how many songs to guess if they want the whole album or just 8 random songs or 10. be sure to show the max for each specific album as all have different number of songs.

at the very end and only when i say we are ready for final phase, we will add React Bits components and finalize the UI.
